                    The UAE's extreme summer heat requires planning for cooling solutions like
                    tents, fans, or misting systems to ensure guest comfort. Evening events or
                    cooler months offer a more pleasant experience for attendees.

                    Public parks and beaches require permits, and organizers must comply with

                    ample time to secure these permits and follow local guidelines to avoid
